    Li-ion (Lithium-ion):\n\nWidely used in smartphones and many electronic devices, Li-ion batteries provide high energy density, lightweight design, and relatively low self-discharge rate.\n\n
    NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride):\n\nOffering a good balance between capacity and cost, NiMH batteries are commonly used in certain devices.\n\n
    Li-poly (Lithium Polymer):\n\nSimilar to Li-ion batteries, Li-poly batteries have a flexible and lightweight form factor. They are often used in slim devices where space is a concern.\n\n
    LiFe (Lithium Iron Phosphate):\n\nProviding a longer lifespan, enhanced safety, and better temperature tolerance, LiFe batteries are commonly used in applications prioritizing durability and stability.\n\n
    NiCd (Nickel Cadmium):\n\nAn older technology with lower energy density and higher self-discharge rate, NiCd batteries are less common nowadays due to environmental concerns.\n\n
    LiMn (Lithium Manganese):\n\nA variant of Li-ion batteries, LiMn batteries offer high power output and stability, making them suitable for applications requiring high current.\n\n
    In smartphones, Li-ion batteries are the most commonly used technology due to their optimal balance of performance, capacity, and safety.

    Standard Downstream Port (SDP):\n\nThis is the most basic form of USB connection. It can be used for data transfer and also to supply power, but it doesn\'t have any special features for charging devices more quickly.\n\n
    Charging Downstream Port (CDP):\n\nThis type of USB connection also supports data transfer, but it can supply more power than an SDP port. This means it can charge devices more quickly while still allowing for data transfer. CDPs were introduced in the USB Battery Charging Specification (Revision 1.2), to address the need of charging batteries of portable devices.\n\n
    Dedicated Charging Port (DCP):\n\nThis type of USB connection doesn\'t support data transfer at all. It\'s only used for charging devices, and it can usually supply even more power than a CDP port. DCP is used when there is a need for more power to charge a device but no data transfer is needed.
